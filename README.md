<h1>thredUp</h1>

I love thrifting. However, sometimes I don't have the time to find the best deals. On thredUp, many items are highly discounted, but there's no way to sort through which ones are the best deal in comparison to their retail price. I wanted to create a website that posts thredUp's best deals each day for various product categories.
